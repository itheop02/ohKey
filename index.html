                            Dear participant, this is a survey that aims to assess different types of privacy policies in terms of comprehensibility and readability. This survey is beeing conducted in the context of my Master's dissertation. The purpose of this comprehensibility assessment is to evaluate the understanding of people ,that may or may not have a legal background, of the privacy policy since it is well known that they are long documents of text and not user friendly. We will analyze the results and we will create a solution based on those. Thank you for participating.
